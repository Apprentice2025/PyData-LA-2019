This tutorial introduces how to make your data exploration and model building process more interactive and exploratory by using the combination of JupyterLab, HoloViews, and PyTorch. HoloViews is a set of Python libraries that offers simple yet powerful visualization and GUI building tools which, together with other data analysis libraries and machine learning framework (eg. PyTorch).   By the end of the talk you will have learned:

- how to make your data exploration more intuitive and experimental using HoloViews libraries
- how to turn your model script into a simple GUI that allows interactive hyperparameter tuning and model exploration
- how to monitor the training process in realtime
- how to quickly build a GUI tool to inspect the trained models in the same Jupyter notebook

To illustrate these steps, I will focus on the problem of classfying different types of roads on satellite images, defined as a multi-class semantic segmentation problem. Starting from the data exploration to the trained model understanding, you will learn different ways to explore the data and models by easily building simple GUIs in a Jupyter notebook.
