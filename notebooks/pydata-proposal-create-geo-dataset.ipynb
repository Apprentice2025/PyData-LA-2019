I will demonstrate <mark>how to do so</mark> with an example of building a neural network to solve the problem of semantic segmentation on satellite images. At each core step of the modeling -- from data exploration to trained model inspection -- I will show different ways to interact with your data and the neural net model to have a better grip on the training process, not only at the end of the trianing, but at intermediate training iterations. \n",
