    "## Overview \n",
    "This tutorial introduces various ways to make your data exploration and modeling process  interactive and exploratory by using the combination of `JupyterLab`, `HoloViz`, and `PyTorch`.  [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org/) is a set of Python libraries that offers simple yet powerful visualization and widget tools which, together with other data analysis libraries (eg. `pandas`, `geopandas`, `numpy`) and machine learning framework (eg. `PyTorch`, `Tensorflow`), can make your experiments more interactive and allows you to experiment with different model configurations through controllable GUIs.   I will start by introducing the four core HoloViz libraries (Holoviews, GeoViews, Panel and Param) and demonstrate basic examples on how we can essentially replace any \"Matplotlib.pyplot\" calls with the equivalents in `HoloViz`.  You will see how this opens up the possibilities to directly interact with your visualization by eg. hovering over the graph to inspect values, querying RGB values of an image on the figure, or querying Lat/Lon values on your map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the introduction to the HoloViz libraries, I will demonstrate how to embellish each step of the machine learning workflow with HoloViz. First, you will see how to turn your PyTorch codes into a GUI object that represents the state of your model (or, the state of your training session). This GUI explicitly exposes your model parameters and training hyperparameters (eg. learning rate, optimizer settings, batch size) as directly tunable parameters.  Compared to conventional ways of specifying the hyperparameter settings with the help of 'argparse' library or config files, this GUI approach integrates seamlessly with the rest of the codes in your notebook and  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After training a neural network model using our own GUI in the notebook, I will demonstrate how to understand the model by visualizing the intermediate layers with HoloViz and test the model with test images directly sampled from HoloViz visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these steps, I will focus on the problem of classfying different types of roads on satellite images, defined as a multi-class semantic segmentation problem.  Starting from the data exploration to the trained model understanding, you will learn different ways to explore their data and models by easily building simple GUIs in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, by the end of the talk the audience will have learned:\n",
    "- how to make their data exploration more intuitive and experimental by using HoloViz libraries\n",
    "- how to turn their codes into a simple GUI that allows the above\n",
    "- how to that exposes \n",
    "the benefits of using `Holoviews`/`Geoviews` for interactively exploring datasets and monitoring their training process\n",
    "- how to use `param` and `panel` to define a neural network whose parameters are configurable via a Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n",
    "- how to build a GUI tool to inspect the trained models in the same Jupyter notebook\n",
    "- practical example codes to experiment these tools on their own datasets and models\n",

    "## Outline\n",
    "This tutorial will consists of five main sections. I will first introduce the basic concepts behind `Holoviews/Geoviews` and `Panel` which are the main libraries we are going to use to add interactive tools for data exploration and model training/evaluation process, all in a single Jupyter notebook.  This will take ~15 minutes.  The rest of the tutorial will flow in the order of the general neural network training workflow, while integrating these libraries at each step. I will leave the last <10 minutes for questions.\n",

    "### Step 0: Introduction to `HoloViz` libraries\n",
    "In this introductory section, I will go over the basic concepts behind the `HoloViz` libraries. I will provide simple examples that show how we can replace any `Matplotlib` plot calls with equivalent calls in `Holoviews/Geoviews` with no hassle, and build easy tools to interact with your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Explore your dataset\n",
    "The first step in building a machine learning model is to understand your dataset. For the scope of this tutorial (ie.semantic segmentation of road types from satellite images), we will use the SpaceNet datasets. More details on how to get the data as well as how the data are collected and annotated can be found [here](https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/datasets/datasetHomePage.html). The original dataset are very large (>100GB) and requires a lot of preprocessing to be useful for training. For example, the RGB images are 16bits of size 1300x1300, and the \"target\" roads are vector lines (as opposed to raster images), which means they need to be rasterized. I have prepared a smaller sample dataset consisting of the RGB images converted to 8bits and cropped to 520x520 size, as well as road buffers as rasters which can be easily used as the target images. I will share the dataset to accompany my tutorial.  The shared dataset will consists of input RGB images and target mask images. Each pixel of a target image will contain one of the labels in {'highway', 'track', 'dirt', 'others'} (as `uint8`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this section is to show how to build a GUI-like visualization of a satellite dataset within a Jupyter notebook using `Holoviews`/`Geoviews`. See Figure 1 (in the shared Google Drive) for an example.  Unlike a static plot (eg. generated from Matplotlib), one can hover over the plot to inspect the label values at each pixel of the mask image and check the lat/lon locations. Furthermore I will show how you can trigger more complicated computations (eg. compute road length within a selected zone), while interacting with the plot (eg. selecting a region by mouse drag, clicking a lat/lon by mouse click)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second example will show how this interactive plot can extended to incorporate external information (eg. roadlines from OpenStreetMap) to easily compare with your own dataset. See Figure 2 (in the shared Google Drive) for a snapshot of such tool.  In this example, as you select different RGB filenames (of your dataset), you have an option to click on the 'click to download OSM' to download the corresponding region's OSM road data, and visualize it as an interactive map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Monitor the training process \n",
    "In this section, I will show how to wrap around a `PyTorch`'s NN model with `param`'s `Parametrized' class to expose its hyperparameters as tunable parameters. Using the GUI representation of the NN model, we can control the (hyper)parameter configurations more intuitively. Its seamless integration into a Jupyter notebook facilitates the experimental side of machine learning training pocess. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Understand what the model has learned \n",
